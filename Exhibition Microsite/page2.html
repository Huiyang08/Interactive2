			“The Queen, The Chairman, and I” is the personal story of photographer and installation artist Kurt Tong’s familial journey from <span id="any">Shanghai</span>, to <span id="any">Hong Kong</span>, to <span id="any">England</span>, and back to <span id="any">Hong Kong</span>. The project began as a visual storybook that Tong was making for his daughters, to tell them about the circumstances and conditions of the Tong clan’s life in Hong Kong, and to answer some of the questions they might have about their heritage and identities. Kurt Tong was born in the city of Hong Kong in 1977; “five years before China wanted it back” is how Tong tells it in his version of the timeline. This push-pull relationship to China, and what it means to be Chinese, is at the heart of the project.</p>

		    Tong tells his story through a variety of photographic objects: old family photographs, some dating back to the 1920s; new photographs taken by Tong around Hong Kong, at locations that hold emotional power; a reconstructed family tree; and a home movie shot on 16mm film around 1949. By shaping these materials of extremely diverse origins and subjects matter into a narrative, Tong has turned the outsider looking in experience of viewing photography on its head, immersing the viewer in his highly subjective universe of meaning, where each object—however banal (a toy clock) or influential (Mao’s The Little Red Book)—exists only for the purpose of his story. Accompanying the exhibition will be an installation of a Chinese tea house, which provides the viewer an opportunity to sit, sip tea, and reminisce about their own family history. By actively engaging the viewer in a dialogue about family histories, Tong invites us to focus on the personal within the historical, while his configuration of the images on the wall subtly reflects the similarities and connectedness of human experiences.</p>
