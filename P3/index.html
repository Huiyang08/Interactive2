	"The Queen, The Chairman, and I"</h4>
	<br>
	<p>
	It is the personal story of photographer and installation artist Kurt Tong's familial journey from <span id="image-1">Shanghai</span>, to <span id="image-2">Hong Kong</span>, to <span id="image-3">England</span>, and back to <span id="image-2">Hong Kong</span>. The project began as a visual storybook that Tong was making for his daughters, to tell them about the circumstances and conditions of the Tong clan's life in Hong Kong, and to answer some of the questions they might have about their heritage and identities. Kurt Tong was born in the city of Hong Kong in 1977; "five years before China wanted it back" is how Tong tells it in his version of the timeline. This push-pull relationship to China, and what it means to be Chinese, is at the heart of the project.</p>
<br>
		<p>
		    Tong tells his story through a variety of photographic objects: old family photographs, some dating back to the 1920s; new photographs taken by Tong around Hong Kong, at locations that hold emotional power; a reconstructed family tree; and a home movie shot on 16mm film around 1949. By shaping these materials of extremely diverse origins and subjects matter into a narrative, Tong has turned the outsider looking in experience of viewing photography on its head, immersing the viewer in his highly subjective universe of meaning, where each object-however banal (a toy clock) or influential (Mao's The Little Red Book)-exists only for the purpose of his story. Accompanying the exhibition will be an installation of a Chinese tea house, which provides the viewer an opportunity to sit, sip tea, and reminisce about their own family history. By actively engaging the viewer in a dialogue about family histories, Tong invites us to focus on the personal within the historical, while his configuration of the images on the wall subtly reflects the similarities and connectedness of human experiences.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>
             Born in Hong Kong in 1977, Kurt Tong was originally trained as a health visitor at the University of Liverpool. He has worked and traveled extensively across Europe, the Americas and Asia. In 1999, Kurt co-founded Prema Vasam, a charitable home for disabled and disadvantaged children in Chennai, South India.</p>
<br>
<p>
             He gained his Masters in documentary photography at the London College of Communications in 2006 and began working on much more personal projects. In Case it Rains in Heaven' exploring the practice of Chinese funeral offerings, has been widely exhibited including a solo exhibition at Compton Verney and features in several public collections. A monograph of the work was published by Kehrer Verlag in 2011.</p>

<br>
<p>
             Much of Kurt's recent work, while remaining photographic in essence, has moved towards installation and sculptural based, pushing the boundaries of the medium. Echoed Visions, a  series of installation question the medium of photography, made its debut at the Identity Art Gallery, Hong Kong in February 2014.</p>

	Where are you from originally?</h4>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
	I was born in the city of <span id="image-2">Hong Kong</span> in 1977, 5 years before <span id="image-8">China</span> wanted it back. Us Honkies have an identity that's very different to the ones of China, after all, I sang '<span id="any1">God Save our Queen</span>' as my national anthem at school. I always knew I was going to live in <span id="image-3">England.</span> My father studied here and dislikes the communists; he had always told me that when <span id="image-2">Hong Kong</span> goes back to China in 1997, we would not be going back.</p>
	<br>
	<p>
    Go back he did. In fact, he never really left. I on the other hand, got sent here for school and I married a Scottish girl and started a family here. Having grown up between three different cultures, one question is always at the back of my mind. How Chinese am I or indeed, <span id="any1">who am I</span>?</p>
    <br>
    <p>
    My father's grandfather was a deckhand who came to <span id="iamge-2">Hong Kong</span> from <span id="image-1">Shanghai</span> after the fall of the Empire in 1911, lured by better job prospects in the relatively stable British colony. My mother's family were big landlords in <span id="image-7">Southern China</span>. They came to <span id="image-2">Hong Kong</span> and probably escaped certain death at the hands of Mao's advancing Communist armies. For 2 years, I traced back the history of my family in a bid to find out how two of the most influential people in history affected my family. Paying equal importance to new photographs, found photographs and writing, the work reconnects me with the Hong Kong of the past through the recollection of my extended family, humanizing the political and social upheaval that brought my family to <span id="image-2">Hong Kong</span> and eventually to the <span id="image-6">United Kingdom</span>.</p>

	  <sapn id="any1">800</sapn> years ago, long before <br>the Tong and Leung Clans settled in what would become Tongs' Bay, the surrunding area was 
	  a banyan tree forest. One day, on his way to the sea, a fisherman noticed that his particular tree resembled the Buddha, siddhartha, Local villagers began praying and carried out offerings around the tree. Later, the Tong's temple was built in front of the tree. Both the temple and the tree survived the Cultural Revolution and still stand today.</p>

	  Bunnan was born in <sapn id="any1">Shanghai</sapn> in 1903. His family were economic migrants, originally from a village called <sapn id="any1">Tangjaiwan</sapn>(Tong's Bay)in Guangdong.</p>
	  <br>
	  <p>His grandfather set up opium pipes for paying customers in an opium den, he died at the age of 27.</p>
	  <br>
	  <p>
	  His father worked as a deckhand and was often away for months at a time.</p>
	  <br>

	  Bunnan's father moved to his family to <span id="image-2">Hong Kong</span> in 1911 after the fall of the Imperial empire. He continued to work as a deckhand on whatever ship he could get a job on and was away for months at a time. He was addicted to opium and would spend his time, whenever the ship docked, smoking the drug that killed his fater.

	  After graduating high school, Bunnan got a job at Jardine Matheson Holdings, one of the biggest British founded Far East Trading companies in <span id="image-2">Hong Kong</span> rumoured to have made their fortune in the trading of opiun in the 19th century.</p>
	  <br>
	 <p>
	  Bunnan worked in the imports and exports department, trading a variety of commodities, with tea and silk being the most profitable goods.</p>

	  After <span id="any1">7</span> years of working at Jardine, Bunnan felt confident that he has learnt everthing he needed to learn and in <span id="any1">1935</span>, started his own trading companies with two German traders.

     During the Japanese occupation of <span id="image-2">Hong Kong</span>, tradingy in Bunnan's company came to a halt. The family of 13 were only able to survive thanks to the insurance money after a vessel carring his stocks sank during a Typhoon on the way to <span id="any1">England</span>, just prior to the fall of <span id="image-2">Hong Kong</span>.</p>

     Prior to the occupation of <span id="image-2">Hong Kong</span> by the Japanese, Bunnan would welcome his third son, Tai Ching in May 1940. A month after his second son was born.</p>

    Tai Ching(far right) grew up with eight sisters who often ganged up on him. His elder brother by 12 yeas had no time for him. He was constantly in direct competition with his half brother, with the two wives using them as pawns to gain Bunnan's attention. Several years later, he was joined by a younger brother who became Bunnan's favourite. Growing up, he enjoyed his own company and spent the majority of his time playing the piano left behind by one of Bunnan's German partners. He also enjoyed making homemade bombs.</p>

    <p>Bunnan began to get involved with a number of charities after ww2. In 1950, he was asked to be on the governor's board to Po Leung Kuk, one of the biggest charities on <span id="image-2">Hong Kong</span> who ran orphanages, women's shelters and schools.

    <p>In <span id="any1">1958</span>, Bunnan's second wife persuaded him to send her son to study in <span id="any1">America</span>. In respond, Shook Yin sent three of her daughters to study in <span id="any1">America</span> and Tai Ching to study in <span id="any1">Longdon</span>. Since <span id="image-2">Hong Kong</span> was a <span id="any1">British</span> colony, a degree from the <span id="any1">United Kingdom</span> was seen as far more prestigious.
